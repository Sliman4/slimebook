# NFTs

NFTs are tokens that can not be divided into smaller units, are unique and not
interchangeable. They can represent ownership of digital assets like art, music,
but can also be used as tickets to real-life events, access keys, and more.

# How to get NFTs
You can buy them on a marketplace, or mint them for free. Here are the most popular
NFT marketplaces on NEAR:
- [Paras](../lvl2/trade-nfts-paras.md)
- [Mintbase](../lvl4/mintbase.md)

There is also an NFT aggregator [TradePort](../lvl4/tradeport.md)

## Free mints
Sometimes creators give away their NFTs for free, either to anyone or with some
conditions. You can find them on Twitter, Discord, and other social media. A good
place to start would be the [Slime Community Discord](https://discord.gg/A5Uh4hhauh)
server. As much as I'd like to have a list of all free mints here, I wouldn't be able
to keep it up to date, but at the time of writing, the next free mint is
[YearOfChef](https://www.yearofchef.org/mint), which only allows minting people who
have donated at least 1 NEAR on [PotLock](../lvl3/potlock.md).

One of the main platforms that provide free mints is [Shard dog](../lvl5/shard-dog.md),
and there's an NFT that is always given away for free for a subscription to a newsletter --
[NearWeek NFT](https://subscribe.nearweek.com/). By the way, [NearWeek](../lvl2/nearweek.md)
is also a good source of information about the NEAR ecosystem.

Usually unlimited freemints like NearWeek NFT are not worth anything, but you might still
want to mint them for fun or for memories of some events.

When you mint an NFT, you may be charged a small [storage fee](../lvl4/storage.md),
usually between 0.01 and 0.05 near, keep that in mind. But your wallet will warn you
about this, anyway.

## NFT analysis
Back in 2021, people were buying useless NFTs for a lot of money, they were just
expensive pictures. Now that the market is more mature, NFTs need to have a clear
use case. If you're looking to buy an NFT that will do something for you (give
access to airdrops, increase in price, etc.), you should do a thorough research and
not base your decision on the price and the picture alone. Of course, if you want to
buy an NFT from your favorite digital artist just to support them, that's a
different story.
