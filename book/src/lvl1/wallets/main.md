# Getting started

Of course, the first thing you need to do is to create a NEAR account using a wallet.

There is no official NEAR Wallet[^1], but there are a lot of wallets
created by other teams. The most popular ones are:
- [Meteor Wallet](meteor-wallet.md) -- web + chrome extension
- [HERE Wallet](here-wallet.md) -- mobile
- [MyNearWallet](my-near-wallet.md) -- web
- [NEAR Mobile Wallet](near-mobile-wallet.md) -- mobile
- [Sender Wallet](sender-wallet.md) -- mobile + chrome extension
- [Nightly Wallet](nightly-wallet.md) -- chrome extension + firefox extension
- [Telegram NEAR Wallet](telegram-near-wallet.md) -- telegram app

There is [a full list of all wallets and their features](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q9ZEeWpFHgcPthSCvzyiVcaKdBIcdS3r96v48OYsDBM/edit),
but I don't recommend using lesser-known wallets, especially if you're new to
the ecosystem, it'll just waste your time and (most likely) not bring any
benefits.

While I aim to keep this book objective, I know you probably don't want to
read 6 pages and compare it yourself, so here's what I recommend:
- If you're on a computer, use [Meteor Wallet](meteor-wallet.md).
- If you're on a phone, use [HERE Wallet](here-wallet.md).

[^1]: There *was* an official [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org/), but it was
deprecated in favor of the community wallets, and discontinued in January 2024.
