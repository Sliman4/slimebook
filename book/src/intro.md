# Intro
Hey, my name is Slime, and this book is my attempt of creating a
comprehensive and somewhat up-to-date NEAR ecosystem guide. Please
let me know in [Telegram](https://t.me/slimedrgn) or [Slime Community Discord](https://discord.gg/A5Uh4hhauh) server
if something is outdated or unclear.

This book is divided by "levels" and in future will be divided by "paths",
so you don't necessarily need to read everything, just read what looks interesting
for you, and feel free to stop reading at the level when it gets too technical.

Some of the pages (about half) are already created and waiting for me to write them,
I think I'll focus on writing all pages as fast as possible so that it can already be
useful, and after that I'll start refining them.

Let's [get started](lvl1/main.md)! ðŸš€
