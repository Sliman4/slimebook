# Meteor Wallet

[Meteor Wallet](https://wallet.meteorwallet.app/add_wallet/create_new?postfix=slime)
is (in my opinion) the simplest and most user-friendly NEAR wallet. It's a web
wallet that can also be used as a Chrome extension.

To create a wallet, open the [Meteor Wallet](https://wallet.meteorwallet.app/add_wallet/create_new?postfix=slime)
website and enter your username:

Yes, as simple as that.

## Next steps
Now you can move some NEAR in your wallet ([Receiving NEAR](../receiving-near.md)) or continue exploring other Meteor
Wallet's features.

In the example above, your address will be `simpleisland-slime.near`.

### Sending NEAR
To send NEAR to someone, you need to know the recipient's account ID (username).
When you have it, you can send NEAR to them:
<br>

You can send other tokens when you click at them, the same menu will open for the selected
token:

### [NFTs](../nfts.md)
Meteor Wallet has a built-in NFT viewer, where you can see your NFTs in the wallet,
view their traits, floor prices, transfer NFTs, and more.
