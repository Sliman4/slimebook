### Creating a Account

Now there are several [ways](../receiving-near.md) you can deposit tokens / NEAR in your newly created wallet.

### Named Address

Unlike Meteor wallet, which lets you create custom named account from the first step, on MyNearWallet, you'll need to reserve your [named address](https://app.mynearwallet.com/create) after initiating the wallet.

To do this, first you will create an implicit account (64 characters) if you haven't yet, and then click "Add a Custom Address" in the banner on the right, or click at the right top corner with accounts > Create New Account, and you will be able to choose a name. Note that you will be charged a small fee for this.

### Staking

![Staking](./my-near-wallet-staking.jpg)

To natively stake NEAR, click the "Staking" tab in the top, and you will see a list of validators with different fees and APY, these are the options to choose from. To know more about staking, read the [staking guide](../../lvl2/staking.md).

## Managing your Wallet:

The "Account" tab provides options to manage your selected account and recovery options in MyNearWallet:

Here's a list of things you can do in this settings tab:
1. View wallet balance breakdown and staking details
2. Change password
3. Connect to a hardware wallet
4. Export [seed phrase](../../lvl4/account-model/keys/where-to-save-seed-phrase.md) and Private Keys.
5. Manage authorized apps and [Access keys](../../lvl4/account-model/keys/index.md):

It also provides [direct links](https://app.mynearwallet.com/explore) to dapps in Near ecosystem under one page:

But I recommend using [NEARCatalog](https://dev.near.org/applications) for a more comprehensive and maintained list of applications.
