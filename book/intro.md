# Intro
Hey, my name is Slime, and this book is my attempt of creating a
comprehensive and somewhat up-to-date NEAR ecosystem guide. Please
let me know in [Telegram](https://t.me/slimedrgn) or [Slime Community Discord](https://discord.gg/A5Uh4hhauh) server
if something is outdated or unclear.

This book is divided by "levels" and in future will be divided by "paths",
so you don't necessarily need to read everything, just read what looks interesting
for you, and feel free to stop reading at the level when it gets too complicated.

If you find this book useful, you can support it by [donating](https://app.potlock.org/?tab=project&projectId=slimebook.near)
or [contributing](contributing.md) to it.

Let's [get started](lvl1/wallets/index.md)! ðŸš€
